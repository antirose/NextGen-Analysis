# NextGen-Analysis
The original goal of this project was to review data gathered from enrollments into the NextGen Employment Services program to improve recruitment of new participants and to recognize motivations of registered participants. Due to the defunding of the program, the data provided for the fiscal year of July 2023 to June 2024 will be the last of its cycle. The updated goal is to recognize the impact of employment support provided by the program for Transitional Age Youth (TAY) within San Francisco.

# About NextGen Employment Services 
NextGen is an employment services program geared towards TAY from 18 to 24 years old in the city of San Francisco. It is a program under the Hire-ability division of Richmond Area Multi-services, a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco, California, United States. Supported by Peer Case Manager, Tonirose Babasoro, and Job Development Specialist, Marcus Morales, participants are offered resources to ensure a holistic journey into employment. The program has been defunded by the San Francisco City & County: Department of Children, Youth & Their Families (DCYF) as of May 2024.

# Data Permission
Approval to use data gathered from enrollment form submissions have been granted by the former Employment Services Manager, Amanda Bambrick, and continued under the current Employment Services Manager, Laura Westman, both supervised by the Director of Vocational Services, Carmen Castorena-O'Keefe. All identifying information has been redacted to protect the privacy of the participants. The data was previously used with intent to better develop recruitment strategies and discerning valuable trends. It will now be used to provide insight into the affect of the program for the fiscal year of July 2022 to June 2023 and July 2023 to June 2024.

# Enrollment Period
The NextGen program was open enrollment so eligible applicants were able to access resources immediately upon enrolling into the program through an online form. The program accepted the last enrollment on May 1, 2024 to focus efforts on closing the program and aiding current participants before the last day of June 28, 2024.
